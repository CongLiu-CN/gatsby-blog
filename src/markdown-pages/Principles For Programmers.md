Advice is easy to give. That is why advice that is given should always
be inspected, debated, and analyzed. What may have worked for one
individual will not necessarily work for everyone or in all situations. 

At the same time, as humans, we are able to learn from the past and
stand on the shoulders of giants. This way, we don't make the same
mistakes over and over. Instead, we get to learn from the mistakes of
the past so that we start on our journey along a path that isn't
completely unknown. If we are able to jump start from other's
experiences, and be efficient in our learning, that is a winning strategy
that will take us far. 

This is the reason for this book. For the past 5 years, I have been
collecting advice, articles, books and opinions of some of the best
programmers, thought leaders, and business people that I know. I
wanted to collect ideas from people with different opinions, and narrow 
down these recommendations to the core and essence. Sometimes I
include principles coming from my own experience, but the goal of this
book is to combine not just my own advice, but to combine the advice
of the top performers and find the commonalities between them so that
you don't have to start from the very beginning.

Whether you are just learning to code, or you have many years of
experience in the industry, you should find something actionable and
valuable in this book for your own situation.

This book is not meant to be read in one sitting. Each principle will
offer its own value. Think of these as tidbits that you can read every
once in a while, come back to, or be reminded of something important,
so that you make sure you are on the correct path to success.

Enjoy, and let's take the leap

# 1. What's NOT going to change in the
next 10 years?

Build a strategy around the things that are stable in time. As a
programmer, you will always have to solve problems. You will always
have to e"ectively communicate with others, and you will always have
to continue to learn and upgrade your skills. Focus a big chunk of your
energy on skills that are virtually guaranteed to be valuable in the
future, no matter what.

# 2. Helping others without answers

Programmers don't grow by being given the answers. They grow by
trying things, experimenting and solving problems themselves. These
are the skills and lessons that will serve them well as they level up their
career. Instead of giving them the answers, give them the tools to find
the answers. Help others by letting them reach a conclusion or solution
on their own. Just guide them in getting to that goal without holding
their hand.



# 3. Beware of the half-life

Everything we know, not just about programming, has an expiration.
The half-life of knowledge is a term to denote the time it takes for half
the knowledge in a domain to be outdated. According to one study, the
half life of an engineer in 1930 was 35 years vs 10 years in 1960 .
Imagine what it is now. Because technology is moving so fast,
eventually the ability to solve problems, and continuously learn, will
become the most sought after skill. This is a muscle that you can train.



# 4. Experience is not created equal

10 years coding by yourself with no other programmers around you,
with no code reviews, doesn't necessarily make you better than
someone who has 1 year of coding experience working on a project
with team members and getting code reviews daily. Get out of your
bubble. Work with others, be surrounded by other programmers and
learn from them. The biggest thing you can do if you are starting out is
to get hired as soon as possible so you can work with others to
accelerate your learning. Let others see your work. Get feedback.
That's how you gain experience.



# 5. Don't follow the money, Follow the brains

Great pay and salary today is good. But if you want to succeed long
term, you are better o" taking a lower pay to be surrounded by smart
people and being in a situation that allows you to learn from others. If
you can get both, that is even better, but always have this as a priority
when picking between options: Which option will allow me to learn and
grow the most and be surrounded by people smarter than me?
