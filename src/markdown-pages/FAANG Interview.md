## Part 1 - FAANG Interview Prep 101

### **Welcome to the FAANG Interview Prep 101 Academy Member Exclusive Workshop.**

Everyone (ok fine... many people) wants to get hired by one of the big tech companies (Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Uber, take your pick!)... you make tons of money, have amazing benefits, etc., etc. Sounds amazing right?!

**The downside?** It's hard.

These companies get 100,000s of applicants and there is no way around it, the only way to get hired is that you have to be able to ace their technical interviews.

**The good news?** You can do it and we're here to help make it happen.

Zero To Mastery Instructor, [Yihua Zhang](https://zerotomastery.io/about/instructor/yihua-zhang) has spent the last 12 months studying and interviewing for basically all of these companies and received multiple offers.

He has lived and breathed this topic day and night so that he could create a proven, repeatable process to help anyone be able to answer absolutely any technical question these companies throw at you.

The goal of this workshop is to give you a realistic sense of how the big tech (FAANG) interview process works as well as walk you through an actual coding interview problem. If you enjoy this workshop and are serious about getting hired at a big tech company, make sure to go take Yihua's new course, [Master the Coding Interview: Big Tech (FAANG) Interviews](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/enrolled/1132099).

**We've also provided some key takeaways, next steps and bonus resources for you after the Part 2 video.**

Enjoy!

**A Few Key Takeaways:**

1. When applying for FAANG companies, **cold applications make up between 1-10% of candidates that get interviews** (depending on the company). The remaining majority of candidates who do get interviews are through internal referrals or employees/ex-employees of other FAANG companies.

2. The technical interviews of FAANG companies comprise of technical topics that you most likely have never worked on before, especially not at the level of proficiency these companies expect from candidates. Unless you are comfortable with competitive programming, fresh out of university with high proficiency in Data Structures + Algorithms or have already worked at FAANG companies before, **you will need to spend 3-6+ months of studying**.

3. The reason it’s so rigorous and intense is because FAANG companies

    

   receive 100,000s of applicants per year

    

   so they need to filter out the best candidates.

   - They offer ludicrous salaries (2-3x the normal salary) on top of providing stock options which can be extremely valuable.
   - You are also working with the very best of the best engineers in the world in a company that is trying to 10x your growth.
   - Having a FAANG company on your resume will open almost every door to any company or opportunity in the future.

4. **You do not need to have a computer science degree.** Anyone who can pass these technical interviews can get a job offer at a FAANG or FAANG-like company. Having the degree doesn’t necessarily help either unless you are applying for an internship position right out of college (top grades from top schools get preference for these positions, but that doesn’t mean they are the ONLY ones who get internships). Candidates applying for non-internship positions should expect to be tested as a general software engineer. Most FAANG companies do not distinguish between frontend and backend engineering roles, candidates are tested as generalists through these technical interviews. **These interviews are designed to test your problem solving skills, communication and ability to solve problems with scalability.**

5. **The key to consistently acing these interviews is practice.** Practice, practice, practice. The quality of practice is also extremely important. You are not trying to memorize hundreds of solutions for technical problems, you are trying to learn the framework for solving these technical problems.

6. Practice solving all your problems by whiteboarding or in a google doc. In your interviews, you should not expect to be given your favorite IDE to write your solution with. This means that all the tools, autocomplete or suggestions that help you code will not be there.

**There are 3 keys for success in technical interviews:**

1. A FULL and rock solid foundation of technical knowledge of the following topics:

   - Computing and deriving Big O for space and time complexity
   - Data Structures & Algorithms
   - Best coding practices (SOLID, DRY, abstraction, functional programming, immutability, etc.)
   - Your coding language specific patterns and tools

2. Critical and abstract problem solving. The technical problems you’ll have to solve often have obstacles or tricks in them that you have to identify through your ability to break them down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. This relies heavily on your problem solving skills and abstract thinking!

3. Communication. You will have to convince your interviewer that you are a great engineer who can work well with others. This means that while you’re problem solving, you need to communicate clearly your thought process so they follow you every step of the way.

**Your Next Steps:**

1. Be honest with yourself and decide if you are ready to commit to this. You’ll need to set aside AT LEAST the next 3 months, 2-6 hours per day to prepare. A very small minority of people can get away with less time, but the vast majority actually need more time.

2. If you’ve decided you can commit the time and you’re ready to get your dream job, prepare a study plan.

   - To build your foundation of knowledge of Data Structures & Algorithms, take [Master the Coding Interview](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/enrolled/700474).
   - Then to build your process & foundation for solving technical problems, take [Master the Coding Interview: Big Tech (FAANG edition)](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/enrolled/1132099).
   - Then start practicing problems by data structure/category. Use Leetcode or HackerRank as your main source of finding technical problems to practice. Figure out where your weaknesses are and try to focus on improving them; there are a lot of variations of question types in each category. You want to aim to be able to comfortably solve ANY medium level question 85-90% of the time on your own within 40 minutes. This is when you can consider yourself "ready".


   1. - If you are interviewing for intermediate or senior roles (ask your recruiter if you are unsure), you will likely need to prepare for a system design interview. If you are unfamiliar with system design, I have linked a great primer in the resources section below.

   - Start applying for companies! Put smaller, less rigorous companies that are not your first choice at the beginning so you can use them as practice. You want to do interviews at your first choice companies last, after you’ve had some practice. Make sure you KEEP PRACTICING during your interview process, it’s very easy to slip and lose the skills you’ve gained; you only finish practicing when you’ve accepted an offer.

**Bonus Resources:**

1. [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) - This will be the home of your practice. Most questions here are community sourced from candidates going through FAANG interviews.

2. [Master The Coding Interview](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/enrolled/700474) - Andrei will teach you the foundation of Big O, Data Structures & Algorithms.

3. [Master The Coding Interview Big Tech (FAANG) Interviews](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/enrolled/1132099) - Yihua and Andrei will teach you the process and framework for solving any technical problem.

4. System design - This topic is hard to prepare for if you don’t have live experience with building distributed systems, but you can still prepare the best you can with the following resources:

   - [System design primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)

   - [Guarav Sen’s youtube playlist on system design](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMCXHnjXnTnvo6alSjVkgxV-VH6EPyvoX)



## Q&A from FAANG Interview Prep 101



We received a lot of great questions as part of the Q&A for the workshop. Many of these questions were answered in the video below. However, we've also provided written Q&A below the video for your benefit as well.

**Workshop specific questions:**

**1. Question:** Where does this example problem in this workshop fall on the spectrum of technical interview questions in terms of difficulty?

**Answer** ➡ The question I cover in this workshop is easy to medium. If you were to solve it using the MOST optimal solution that involves Hoare’s quickselect algorithm (which you can learn in [Master the Coding Interview: Big Tech (FAANG) Interviews](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/enrolled/1132099)) it would be medium.

**2. Question:** Is Lyft considered a FAANG-like company?

**Answer** ➡ Yes! Major rideshare and delivery companies would all fall in this category. They may not all interview using the same style though so try to find that out during your research into the company and by speaking with engineers who have interviewed at or work at the specific company you're applying for.

**General questions:**

**1. Question:** Is a bachelor's degree required to get hired at a FAANG company as a Web Developer (Frontend, Backend, Full Stack)? What type of degree would help if one is required? Would it be helpful to get a more focused CS degree like Information Systems, etc.?

**Answer** ➡ The short answer is that if you’re a US citizen then, no. It can definitely help but it definitely is no means required. I don’t have one and they hire many people without them as well.

As an example, here’s exactly what Google says on [their website](https://careers.google.com/how-we-hire): "No, a CS degree isn’t required for our software engineering or product manager roles." These big tech companies want to hire the best people, no matter their background. Someone that has worked extremely hard and didn't have the opportunity to attend a prestigious College can be even more impressive.

**2. Question:** Where/how do I find a coding mentor in a specific programming field? What are good ways to network during Covid19?

**Answer** ➡ Hands down the best way to find a coding mentor is through working at a company. You can also try to go through doing open-source community stuff but mentorship is a lot more rare outside of a work environment. For networking during this crazy covid-19 time, you can join online communities like ZTM and also find other online coding groups.

**3.** **Question:** Could you tell us a bit about your prep for system design? I haven't ever seen any super solid advice in how it goes or how to prepare if you ever reach that level. I heard mid-level engineers might need to go through even 1 round of system design. Is that true?

**Answer** ➡ System design is tough because you need experience working on large distributed systems to have hands on experience with designing them (making tradeoffs, thinking about the features, etc.). If you have absolutely no experience but are going through a system design interview regardless, I would say [Gaurav Sen’s Youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMCXHnjXnTnvo6alSjVkgxV-VH6EPyvoX) on system design is good to get an idea of what the interview looks like as well as some of the technical topics you’ll need to learn.

**4. Question:** How important is having a LinkedIn with lots of connections to people in FAANG and FAANG-like companies?

**Answer** ➡ To be honest, how many connections you have isn’t all that important. Given the thousands of applicants these companies get, it’s probably unlikely they even look at your LinkedIn profile. What matters is referrals. You want to be connected with people that will tell their connections that they’ve worked with and will vouch for you as being in the top 5-10% of developers they’ve worked with. You also want to be connected with people that can vouch for the type of work ethic and skills you have because you’ve worked on open-source or side projects together. Like many other things, quality of connections is more relevant than quantity of connections.

**5. Question:** Does a person need to be well versed in “competitive programming”?

**Answer** ➡ The short answer is no, you don't. However, it helps because competitive programming overlaps with the technical problems you solve in these interviews, but competitive programming focuses on speed and completion whereas these interviews place more emphasis on communication and explaining your process. It can help, but you have to make sure that you work on communicating how you solve problems, and writing good code and following best practices as a developer.

**6. Question:** Is it enough to have a strong grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms to get shortlisted or should I diversify myself in the other fields like Machine Learning?

**Answer** ➡ Unless the team you’re interviewing for requires knowledge of Machine Learning in their product, it generally won’t be important. Your time will be better spent focusing on improving your Data Structure & Algorithms knowledge, practicing questions and doing things to make you stand out from others.

**7.** **Question:** How important is it to have certifications like AWS Certified Developer or nanodegrees from Udacity?

**Answer** ➡ Not very important. The primary focus will be around your ability to pass the technical interviews. In a absolute vacuum having it may be slightly better than not, but the effort to obtain those certifications and degrees would be better spent preparing for the interviews themselves!

**8.** **Question:** How do I know that I am ready to apply for a software engineering job at a FAANG company?

**Answer** ➡ When you’re able to easily and consistently solve medium level questions on Leetcode by yourself 80-90% of the time, I would say you’re ready. You still need to keep practicing even while you interview!

**9.** **Question:** Does an internship at a FAANG company help you get a full-time job? If so, what’s the best way to get an internship at a FAANG company?

**Answer** ➡ Yes it does! It mostly helps in that it will almost guarantee that you'll have the opportunity to interview for a full-time position. However, you will still have to be able to pass the technical interview like everyone else. Getting an internship can be challenging and typically is pretty exclusive for university students from a comp sci or computer engineering/math background.

**10.** **Question:** Based on your FAANG interview experiences, are the questions you get evenly distributed across topics and difficulty, or are they centered around some more advanced topics such as DP (dynamic programming), trie, etc.?

**Answer** ➡ You can definitely expect tree questions, array questions and graph questions. I would be hesitant to guarantee a DP problem because they are very time consuming but they do show up from time to time. If you have to prioritize topics I would say Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs and Dynamic Programming (because if you get one, you need to at least be familiar with the process of solving them).

**11. Question:** If I apply for a web developer position at a FAANG company, should I follow the path of [Master The Coding Interview: Data Structures and Algorithms](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/enrolled/700474) first? What should my preparation path be?

**Answer** ➡ You typically wouldn't apply as a web developer. You would apply as a software engineer/developer. At many FAANG companies they don’t distinguish between frontend and backend when it comes to hiring engineers. They are looking to hire generalist software engineers so everyone gets the same interview UNLESS you’re applying for a special team that has specific needs (ex: a Machine Learning specific team). Facebook does distinguish frontend and backend engineering applicants that are applying for L4-L5+ roles where it changes if you get a system design interview (backend) versus product design (frontend), but these are more intermediate to senior roles.

In terms of your preparation path, you should definitely start with the [first Master The Coding Interview course](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/enrolled/700474) before taking the [FAANG Preparation course](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/enrolled/1132099) and consider taking the [Advanced JavaScript course](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/enrolled/698487) as well. When in doubt, refer to [this roadmap](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/#roadmap).

**12.** **Question:** How much actual coding is typically part of the Technical Interviews? Or is it mostly just whiteboarding?

**Answer** ➡ Coding is definitely weighted heavily in the interview, but you will have to be comfortable writing code on a whiteboard or an IDE similar to a google doc (i.e. no helpful hints or autocomplete features you’re used to with your working IDE).

**13.** **Question:** Does having projects help to get interviews with FAANG companies?

**Answer** ➡ It’s helpful, but not as heavily weighted as having a referral.

**14.** **Question:** Are there usually any relational database questions?

**Answer** ➡ If the team you’re going to be staffed on has a heavy importance on databases, then it’s definitely possible. Your recruiter should tell you roughly what to expect.

**15.** **Question:** I am currently doing Complete React Developer, what should I learn after I finish it?

**Answer** ➡ If you're set on getting hired at a FAANG or FAANG-like company, then you should take [Master the Coding Interview: Big Tech (FAANG) Interviews](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/enrolled/1132099). Otherwise, you can use [our roadmap](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/#roadmap) to help you decide what path is best for you.

**Personal situation questions:**

**1. Karim:** I currently work as an IT professional and I want to work at one of the big tech companies, specifically FAANG. However, despite having a computer engineering degree, since my graduation date was in January 2019, companies now do not consider me for new grad roles, and they consider my graduation date out of their range. I even passed a coding challenge for Goldman Sachs, but they rejected my application only because of my graduation date. I believe my profile and resume are strong enough as they were reviewed by specialists. So how do I go about this? Are there specific positions in FAANG for people who are not recent graduates but have no experience in software engineering?

**Answer** ➡ Generally speaking, FAANG companies have different buckets they put potential candidates, and for new roles for fresh grads they prioritize bucketing students based on a mix of their school GPA, extracurriculars and general interviewing skills of the candidate. I’m not entirely sure why your graduation date would pose a problem, but if you find that it’s a repetitive problem in your job hunt, I would work for a year so that you move into a different bucket from new grads. Once you have a year of experience, you become a working professional with 1 year of experience which is different from new grads. The way they bucket does vary from company to company though so you just have to try and apply for as many companies as you can!

**2.** **Vaibhav:** I am turning 40 next year and have been a backend Java developer throughout my career. I now want to pursue Machine Learning especially [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming) as I work for a translation company. My target is to finish all the courses and get ready for the interviews by March 2021. How hard is it for someone like me to get into FAANG ML team at my age?

**Answer** ➡ I’m not sure about the ML teams in FAANG, but if it’s difficult to break in through ML, it’s definitely possible to crossover once you are already in the company. You can apply and get a role as a backend engineer or general software engineer and then request a transfer at some point to a ML team. FAANG companies are very favorable to internal transfers because you’ve already proved yourself by passing their interview process.

**3. Vikram:** I'm already 25 now and I don't have a CS degree and I have no work experience. What is the possibility of me getting the job at these big companies even if I have a good portfolio, projects, and am good at data structures and algorithms? I feel like there are 18-year-old kids who are already great in data structures and algorithms and getting gold medals in IOI. They are going to get better in 1 or 2 years, what are the odds of me getting a job when these people exist?

**Answer** ➡ First, no matter what your scenario is, it takes a lot of work and dedication to get a job at these companies.

Second, find ways that YOU can stand out from other candidates. Many times the best way to do this is to find a smaller company to join where there are people that you can learn from. In the meantime, you need to be studying, studying, studying and maybe even working on side projects. This will improve your skills and show your dedication.

Third, network. Getting referrals is a great way to increase your chances of getting an interview. Whether that's co-workers you're working with and you're proving to them that you work harder than everyone else or people already in your network or people you meet through dev communities / open-source projects or people you reach out to and build relationships with.

Fourth, mindset. You have to the mindset that it doesn't matter what other candidates have or don't have. You can only control YOUR own effort so focus on that and use my [FAANG Interview Prep course](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/enrolled/1132099) as a guide!

**4.** **Anonymous:** I’m learning programming as a career change like many people. I don't have a degree, have no experience in the tech field and am 41 years old now. Will I even be able to get a position at FAANG company? What advice/recommendations would you give to have the best to change to even get an interview at a FAANG company?

**Answer** ➡ It’s definitely possible! You just have to figure out how *you* stand out from other applicants (which companies do value) and leveraging your maturity, life experience and working experience can help make a strong case. Of course, you’ll have to pass the technical interview like everyone else, but age does not necessarily mean it will work against you. An exceptional developer is an exceptional developer and that’s what FAANG companies are looking for.

There are many students of Zero To Mastery from all age categories. [Here is a story of someone who got scouted by Google at age 38](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/career-change-at-38-transitioning-to-software-developer-in-6-months-scouted-by-google) (again, just to show that age doesn't mean anything).

**New Questions (added October 2020):**

**1.** **Question:** During the technical interviews (online and also on-site), will the interviewer also test your knowledge on topics like databases or system design for SW engineering positions? In addition, is there a possibility of testing your knowledge on low level topics like computer architecture + pointers, etc. In other words, will ALL of the technical questions, including on-site, revolve around JUST solving problems with code + data structures + algorithms?

**Answer** ➡ There is some degree of variance based on the company you're applying to. Some companies will have a specific team in mind that they're looking to hire for, others figure that out after they hire you for a general SWE role. In either case, your internal recruiter will be the one who can tell you those details; particularly if you are interviewing for a role on a specific team and what that team expects you to be able to answer.

The hiring manager on that team will be the one corresponding with your recruiter about what they want to make sure you know. Generally there will always be data structures + algorithms, but if the team they want you on does A LOT of database work or backend work or even front end work, they may test you a bit on your knowledge in those domains. However, despite this you can be guaranteed that the bulk of your questions will be on data structures + algorithms.

If you're interviewing for intermediate positions and higher, you should also expect a system design interview. As for lower level topics such as pointers and computer architecture, it's unlikely unless the team you'd be on expects you to work with those topics to some degree. Once again, your recruiter will know or at least be able to figure that out for you.

**2.** **Question:** Does knowing multiple programming languages increase the odds of getting hired or does that not really matter as long as you know ONE language very well? I hear different things regarding this issue and would like your take.

**Answer** ➡ Not to sound like a broken record, but it does depend on the company you're applying to and if they're trying to place you on a specific team! In general, they expect you to be deeply familiar with any language you're proficient in, or at least expect you to know how to utilize it efficiently to solve Data Structure + Algorithm problems without their help.

Knowing more languages may not necessarily make you a more viable candidate overall, but it may make you more viable for wider variety of teams that they could put you on! For example, let's say all you know is Javascript and you're interviewing with a company that needs to hire for three teams. Only one of those teams works in Javascript, the other two use Objective C and Java, respectively. Technically, those other two teams may be totally comfortable hiring you as long as you ace the technical coding interviews, but they would obviously prefer a candidate who also aced the technical interview BUT has knowledge in the language they're already using.

To summarize: knowing multiple languages most likely won't matter UNLESS the circumstances are that a specific team cares that you know their language. This can be information that you might be able to get by asking the recruiter you're working with.
