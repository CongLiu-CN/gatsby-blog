* ##### Note: Correction for explanation of +1

  Hello everyone!

  One quick correction about the reason we add +1 when we update our **maxLength** i.e.

  ```
  longest = Math.max(longest, right - left + 1);
  ```

  In the video I explain it's because we are indexed from 0, but this is a mistake on my part! The reason we add one is because we want the count of elements from the **right** to **left** indices, not the span of elements between them. The reason for this is because when we're counting elements between a range, i.e. elements 8 to 11, we have 4 elements [8, 9, 10, 11]. But when we subtract, we are asking for the difference between these elements i.e. 11 - 8 = 3 which is how many elements are there between 11 and 8 (which is 3). The reason for this is because when we subtract, we're calculating the number of "spans" there are between elements, and when we think about it like that, a span touches 2 elements.

  This can be visualized like so:

  8------9------10------11

  

  If we count the number of elements between 8 and 11, there are 4:

  **1**    **2**    **3**    **4**

  [8]------[9]------[10]------[11]

  But if we get the span between them we end up counting the number of spaces between the numbers

    **1**    **2**    **3**

  8[------]9[------]10[------]11

  

  Because we want the former not the latter, we have to add 1 after subtracting!

  

  [You can find a more detailed breakdown of this concept at this link.](https://betterexplained.com/articles/learning-how-to-count-avoiding-the-fencepost-problem/)

* ##### Correction About Time Complexity!

  Hello everyone!

  One quick correction about the time complexity of our quickselect algorithm, in our best case/average case scenario the time complexity is actually `O(N)` not `O(logN)`! The reason it is `O(N)` is because every iteration we are scanning through the array to find the partition point, once we find the partition we continue with the side of the partition that contains the index we're searching for and so on and so forth. This means that we search through the entire array on the first iteration, and in an ideal world the partition index we find is in the middle of the search space every single time, we are cutting our search space in half.

  This means we get `O(N + N/2 + N/4 + N/8 + N/16)` .... which as we know is equal to `O(2N)` which is `O(N)`. The worst case is `O(N^2)` just like quicksort because if the partition element we choose each time ends up being the very last element index, then we actually only reduce our search space by 1 element, which means we get `O(N + N - 1 + N - 2 + N - 3 + N - 4....)` which is `O(N^2)`!

  My apologies for the confusion!

  Happy coding everyone!

* ##### Dynamic Programming Question List

  Here is a good list of common patterns amongst dynamic programming questions you will come across! This is certainly not an exhaustive list as there are many different variations of questions and patterns within dynamic programming. One key thing to note is that it is not extremely common to get dynamic programming as a question in your interview because of the time it takes, BUT it is still important to practice solving up through the recursive solutions with DP. It's very unlikely you'll have enough time to get through the tabulation solution in the allotted hour time of your interview so it's not necessary to come up with it to pass the interview! One thing to note is that dynamic programming is incredibly challenging to learn and takes a lot of time, so don't spend all your time learning dynamic programming because it is a massive time sink. Prioritize your study time accordingly!

  2. [Best time to buy and sell stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)
  3. [House robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)
  4. [Longest common subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)

  9. [Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)
  10. [Minimum path sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/)

  [Here is a great post on common dynamic programming patterns](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/458695/dynamic-programming-patterns)! It is very time consuming to do all the questions, once again only prioritize doing dynamic programming to this extent if you have a solid grasp on everything else!
