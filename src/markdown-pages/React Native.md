* **In the following videos you will see me setup MealsToGo on a MAC environment, some of the commands I type in may not work on other Operating Systems. DON'T PANIC!**

  Rest assured that the main commands we run to setup project should work for you, but because we are on a MAC environment things like `ls` may not work on your Windows system.

  `expo init` should still work and be available to you which is the main command we need.

  If you do run into issues make sure to follow the documentation steps: `https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/`

  If it's still causing issues reach out to our amazing Discord community or the QA section!

* ##  Quick Note On Publishing Your App

  Before we get going I thought it would be of importance to point something out.

  Unlike with FocusTime, when we start building locally we can **only** run our app on our phone **when we are running expo locally**.

  

  What this means is that if you shut your laptop, or turn off expo you won't be able to see your app unless you start expo again. It's important to know that this is **NOT** a limitation but how expo development works. This is what we call a **local build.**

  *You have a "local" build that will run while your development environment is running.*

  In the flow of the course we assume that you build all of meals to go's main flow before "publishing" your app to expo which will allow you to access the version of your app that you publish without having the run the local environment. If you're interested in doing this throughout the course rather then at the end check out our video on **Expo Publish** or [read the docs](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/publishing/)

  

  *Note here that "publishing your app to expo" is* ***NOT\*** *the same as publishing your app to the app store, we will cover that in a bonus section.*

* ## Additional Changes For Android To Take a Picture

  

  In the previous video we saw an approach to taking a picture. Depending on the Android device you own it will render out the camera module differently. Some additional fixes may be required to allow android to properly snap a photo.

  In this scenario we looked at changing our implementation so it can work both on iOS and Android appropriately.

  

  Also our usage of `useFocusEffect` was not utilized according to the documentation so additional changes are required there.

  

  Be aware with these changes on Android you may still be required to give a `ratio` prop to the camera for instance

  ```
  <ProfileCamera ref={(camera) => (cameraRef.current = camera)} type={Camera.Constants.Type.front} ratio={"16:9"} >
  ```

  

  You can read up on this in the docs: [Camera - Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/camera/)

* ## Quick Note On Running Functions Locally

  

  In the next video I will be showing you how run your firebase functions locally, **make sure** that you run the command to start the functions inside of the folder of the function itself, do not try to start your firebase function from any other folder or it will **NOT** work.

  As an example, if your folder is

  ```
  MealsToGo/
  ```

  

  Make sure in your terminal you navigate to your functions folder, by running the command:

  ```cmd
  cd functions
  ```

## Appendix: Learn React

* ## Before We Start

  

  Heads up! In this section, we are assuming you have Node installed on your computer and that you know how to use Git and Github. If you do not have either of these:

  

  \1. Go watch the **MAC: Node + VS Code Setup** or **Windows: Node + VS Code Setup** videos to install Node on your computer.

  \2. Go watch the section **Appendix: Git + Github** videos.

  

  Alternatively, you can always use https://codesandbox.io/s/new to follow along without installing anything and just using your browser.

  

  Otherwise, let's get started and learn React!

* [Introduction To React.js](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/yHyyX8bHQiCJjOnbNOXB)

* ## Quick Note: CRA Growing Pains

  

  In the next 3 videos, we are going to be talking about a tool called Create React App!

  

  Although only in the 3rd video, we show you how to use the latest version of this tool, I want you to make sure you watch all 3 videos because it will show some important concepts and also demonstrate how tools get updated as time progresses. We will also discover how programmers can update these tools to make sure we are taking advantage of the latest and greatest. You won't need to follow along (code-along) until the **create-react-app 3** video. Enjoy!

  Here is the code from the previous video that you should have in your App.js file! The important thing is that this component is a CLASS instead of FUNCTION!

  ```react
  import React from 'react';
  import logo from './logo.svg';
  import './App.css';
  
  class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <div className="App">
          <header className="App-header">
            <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
            <p>
              Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
            </p>
            <a
              className="App-link"

* ## Next Steps

  Congratulations! You have just learned React! It is now time for you to keep going with the course and dive into the world of React Native. I know we are still getting started and things may not 100% be clear for you, but we promise that what you have learned up until now will allow you to do some amazing things in the field of React Native. Hang in there and jump back to **The 2 Paths** section and start watching the videos in there!

  Ps If you want to dive deeper into this section and learn React even more in depth, you can take the full React Web Development course by ZTM: **Complete React Developer: Zero to Mastery**

## Appendix: Git + Github

* [CWD: Git + Github](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/VlXPrio1SWePxOPp1akL)

* ## Github Update: Master --> Main

  Heads up! In the next video we are going to be speaking about Github and branching. Recently Github has decided to rename the original branch from `master` to `main` . If you want to find out the reason why they did this, you can read about it [here](https://github.com/github/renaming) *(main is less offensive than master).*

  

  For this reason, for any new Github repositories created from now on *(old ones will stay the same with master as the main branch)*, you will have to use `main` instead of `master`. So anytime you see me use master, simply replace it with main in the next video!

  

  For example if you see a command like:

  ```
  git push origin master
  ```

  it should now be:

  ```
  git push origin main
  ```
