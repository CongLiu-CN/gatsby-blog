The most damaging thing you learned in school wasn't something you learned in any specific class. It was learning to get good grades.  

你在学校里受到最坏的教育，不是上了哪门专业课，而是坚信学习就是为了考高分。

When I was in college, a particularly earnest philosophy grad student once told me that he never cared what grade he got in a class, only what he learned in it. This stuck in my mind because it was the only time I ever heard anyone say such a thing.

我在大学时，有位非常优秀的哲学系研究生对我说过，他从来不在意考多少分，只在乎学到了多少知识。这句话烙印在我脑海中，因为它是我闻所未闻的理念。

For me, as for most students, the measurement of what I was learning completely dominated actual learning in college. I was fairly earnest; I was genuinely interested in most of the classes I took, and I worked hard. And yet I worked by far the hardest when I was studying for a test.

对于我，以及大多数大学生来说，我们更加重视考试，而忽略了学习本身。那时我对学习充满热情；对大多数学科都发自内心地感兴趣，下了很多苦功夫。在备考阶段，我是全校最努力的学生。

In theory, tests are merely what their name implies: tests of what you've learned in the class. In theory you shouldn't have to prepare for a test in a class any more than you have to prepare for a blood test. In theory you learn from taking the class, from going to the lectures and doing the reading and/or assignments, and the test that comes afterward merely measures how well you learned.

按字面意思，考试不过是检验一个人课上所学的一次测验。同理，学生们根本不应该为了考试而刻意准备，就像人们不会为了验血而提前准备一样。理想情况下，学生只需认真听课，认真做作业，然后等着考试来检验就可以了。

In practice, as almost everyone reading this will know, things are so different that hearing this explanation of how classes and tests are meant to work is like hearing the etymology of a word whose meaning has changed completely. In practice, the phrase "studying for a test" was almost redundant, because that was when one really studied. The difference between diligent and slack students was that the former studied hard for tests and the latter didn't. No one was pulling all-nighters two weeks into the semester.

读者看到这里，常常会想现实并非如此。考试与学习二者，怎如同单词与词源一样八竿子打不着？是啊，现在人们只会讲“学习”，没有人会刻意地强调“为了考试学习”。谁学习不是“为了考试”？一个学生是勤奋还是懒惰的唯一区别：前者会在考前高强度突击复习，而后者不会。没人会两个星期一直通宵学习。

Even though I was a diligent student, almost all the work I did in school was aimed at getting a good grade on something.

那时我虽然算是个勤奋的学生，但是我所做的一切也不过是为了考高分。

To many people, it would seem strange that the preceding sentence has a "though" in it. Aren't I merely stating a tautology? Isn't that what a diligent student is, a straight-A student? That's how deeply the conflation of learning with grades has infused our culture.

大多数人可能很难理解上面那句话中的“虽然”和“但是”。我前半句和后半句难道不是一个意思吗？学习就是为了好成绩，这是根深蒂固的观念。好学生不就是成绩好的学生吗？

Is it so bad if learning is conflated with grades? Yes, it is bad. And it wasn't till decades after college, when I was running Y Combinator, that I realized how bad it is.

难道学习与成绩挂钩有什么不好吗？这确实不好。直到大学毕业几十年后，我执掌了一家

，才真正明白其坏处。

I knew of course when I was a student that studying for a test is far from identical with actual learning. At the very least, you don't retain knowledge you cram into your head the night before an exam. But the problem is worse than that. The real problem is that most tests don't come close to measuring what they're supposed to.

我当然清楚，学生时代的应试教育与真正的教育相差甚远。至少我敢说考前一晚硬塞进脑子的算不上真才实学。但这还不算什么。真正的问题是大多数考试根本无效。

If tests truly were tests of learning, things wouldn't be so bad. Getting good grades and learning would converge, just a little late. The problem is that nearly all tests given to students are terribly hackable. Most people who've gotten good grades know this, and know it so well they've ceased even to question it. You'll see when you realize how naive it sounds to act otherwise.

假若考试能够检验学习效果，一切就好办了。好成绩和学得好，早晚会殊途同归。但问题是，几乎所有的考试都是有规律可循的。大部分考场得意之人对此都心照不宣，完全不会去质疑考试。假若有谁去质疑，那这个人真是太天真了。

Suppose you're taking a class on medieval history and the final exam is coming up. The final exam is supposed to be a test of your knowledge of medieval history, right? So if you have a couple days between now and the exam, surely the best way to spend the time, if you want to do well on the exam, is to read the best books you can find about medieval history. Then you'll know a lot about it, and do well on the exam.

假设你上了门中世纪历史课，期末考试将至。期末考试要考你中世纪历史，对吧？假如还有几天就考试了且你想考好，你最好多花点时间看一些中世纪历史经典书目。这样一来，你就会提升知识储备，成绩也就跟着提高了。

No, no, no, experienced students are saying to themselves. If you merely read good books on medieval history, most of the stuff you learned wouldn't be on the test. It's not good books you want to read, but the lecture notes and assigned reading in this class. And even most of that you can ignore, because you only have to worry about the sort of thing that could turn up as a test question. You're looking for sharply-defined chunks of information. If one of the assigned readings has an interesting digression on some subtle point, you can safely ignore that, because it's not the sort of thing that could be turned into a test question. But if the professor tells you that there were three underlying causes of the Schism of 1378, or three main consequences of the Black Death, you'd better know them. And whether they were in fact the causes or consequences is beside the point. For the purposes of this class they are.

久经考场的学生会认为这是大错特错！如果你只看一些中世纪历史经典著作，那么你真正去考试时多半不会遇到你学到的内容。你不应该去看经典著作，你应该去看课堂笔记和老师留的阅读作业。在笔记和作业中，大部分的东西也可以不必看，你只需要关注能够出题的部分。你应该寻找一看就是考试大纲范围内的信息。如果一篇阅读作业讲的是细枝末节，你可以放心地无视它，因为这种信息无法在考试中以问题出现。但是，如果老师明确地告诉过你引发1378年亚维侬分裂的三个原因，或黑死病导致的三个后果，那么你最好把这些背下来。至于这些实际上到底是原因还是后果其实无关紧要。重要的是这些是期末考试中的标准答案。

At a university there are often copies of old exams floating around, and these narrow still further what you have to learn. As well as learning what kind of questions this professor asks, you'll often get actual exam questions. Many professors re-use them. After teaching a class for 10 years, it would be hard not to, at least inadvertently.

大学里一般都会流传着过往考试的试卷，这让你需要学习的范围进一步缩小了。你不仅清楚老师会问什么样的问题，你同样得到了真实的考试题。很多出题老师会重复用旧题。对于教龄十年的教师，他想不用旧题也难。

In some classes, your professor will have had some sort of political axe to grind, and if so you'll have to grind it too. The need for this varies. In classes in math or the hard sciences or engineering it's rarely necessary, but at the other end of the spectrum there are classes where you couldn't get a good grade without it.

有些课的老师会有政治立场，这种情况下你要附和他。这要看情况。有些课程你不需要，比如数学课、科学或者工程学的主干学科。但是对于一些冷门课程，你不这么做就得不了高分。

Getting a good grade in a class on x is so different from learning a lot about x that you have to choose one or the other, and you can't blame students if they choose grades. Everyone judges them by their grades — graduate programs, employers, scholarships, even their own parents.

考好一门课不等于学好一门课。二者相差甚远，你通常只能选择一样。如果有学生选择了成绩，你也不能怪他。人人都看成绩——研究生项目、雇主、奖学金、甚至他们的父母。

I liked learning, and I really enjoyed some of the papers and programs I wrote in college. But did I ever, after turning in a paper in some class, sit down and write another just for fun? Of course not. I had things due in other classes. If it ever came to a choice of learning or grades, I chose grades. I hadn't come to college to do badly.

我曾经热爱学习，热爱大学时完成的论文和项目。但是我可曾在课堂之外，单纯为兴趣而动一笔？当然没有，我还要赶着完成其他科目的任务。假若让我在学习和成绩中选择，我会选成绩。我当年可不是打算去大学混日子的。
