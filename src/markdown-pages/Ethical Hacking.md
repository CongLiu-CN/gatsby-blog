* [Why Linux ?](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/U74FPvRAT3SFtLdnxnqI)

* [Downloading Virtual Box & Kali Linux](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/eiT7TFSNS0OrMBnG3sv8)

* ##### Note: Kali Linux Updates All The Time!

  ***Helloooo!\***

  We have just learned from where we can download the Kali Linux Operating System And Virtual Box. But when it comes to Kali Linux it gets around **4-5 updates** every year! We must make sure to keep up with everything that they add to each update(sometimes they can be huge updates but usually they are not). For more information about this and for more information about installing older versions of Kali Linux, check out the lecture called "***New & Old Versions Of Kali Linux\***" from this section!

* [Update 1 - New & Old Versions of Kali Linux](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/W60g4AKQMapZ6mY4ZZyP)

* ###### Networking Basics

  Some Networking knowledge is essential to fully understand all of the attacks that we will be doing inside the course! We must be familiar with terms such as DNS, Router, IP addresses and more. That is why we made this file that will explain all of the important networking terms that we use inside the course and we will also put resource inside there to expand your skills in Networking even more if that is what you desire!

* ##### Note: Getting Familiar With Kali Linux!

  ***Optional\***

  Okay, We performed the needed setup. But for many of you this will be something new and you aren't really that familiar with Kali Linux or Linux Operating System in general. Don't worry! In the next section we will be covering some of the Linux basics and terminal basics so you will fully understand all the commands that we ran in previous video and many more! However you also might want to check out some of the things that you could do after installing Kali Linux(optional):

  https://www.ceos3c.com/hacking/top-things-after-installing-kali-linux/

  Take a look at this page for more information as to what you can do after installation, keep in mind that some of the things we will cover later in the course, but if you feel comfortable doing them now go ahead! Nonetheless now that we have everything ready, Lets talk about process of a Penetration Test!

* [5 Stages Of A Penetration Test](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/MmTE9aFCRVmkTVhDaNxW)

### Linux Operating System

* [Navigating Through Linux System](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/ym0CDVpOT6TQcrMHNt9O)

* [Creating Files & Managing Directories](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/voF8VJ9OTgikHDAIJdNe)

* [Network Commands & Sudo Privileges In Kali](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/33KuRjmuRjiigSnLHdlg)

* ###### Note: Linux File System & Additional Commands

  How ***WELL\*** do you think you know terminal commands or Linux File System ?

  If you want to know even more about how Linux is structured and what each of /home, /var, /etc .. directories are, you can take a look at this link right here explaining Linux Files Tree and discussing about each directory a little bit.

  https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/linux-filesystem-explained/

  Another thing you might want to learn is different terminal commands. Even though we covered some of them and we will cover even more throughout the course it is still good to practice all of the things we covered in this section and perhaps learn 1 or 2 new commands! Remember, terminal is ***THE MOST IMPORTANT\*** tool that you will use as a penetration tester!

* [Aggressive Website Technology Discovering on IP Range](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/VFhfVjqeRFGytSQzOMGa)

* ##### Note: Same Tools Different Results!

  Alright, we just started introducing ourselves to different tools that are used for information gathering. But it is important to widen our tool collection as much as possible. **We want to know different tools that do same things** .. Why you might be asking ? Well tools are unreliable, and sometimes one of them will break, or it wont give us result that we want. In that case it is good to have a backup plan just to be able to get information that you want. For example in the next video you will see a scenario where one of the tool fails, and you will notice that we didn't just quit once we got no results with that tool. We found another alternative that gave us the results that we want. So what is important to learn out of this ?

* ###### ZTM Nmap Cheatsheet

  In order to help test your knowledge, but to also help you learn and remember common Nmap syntax and to use as a handy reference for what you've just learned, one of our ZTM Community Star Mentors has created a [**ZTM Nmap Cheat Sheet**](https://zerotomastery.io/cheatsheets/nmap-cheat-sheet) for you!

  In this Nmap cheat sheet, you will find both Nmap command examples as well as explanations of when and why you would use certain options and arguments.

  It also provides you with an overview of which commands require root/sudo privileges and compare the noise levels (measures the likelihood of alarming the target that you are scanning) of various commands.

  There are a lot of Nmap commands that you can use that are very detailed and advanced. But the chances of ever needing to use them for the majority of users/students is quite low so we've kept this Nmap Cheat Sheet focused on the most important commands that you need to know and will use most often.

* [Security Evasion Nmap Options](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/Z7qPmugXRliGkIhzItaF)

* ##### Note: Time To Switch Things Up!

  We obtained all of the information we need to attack our target, from what Operating Systems it has to which ports it has open and which software it has running on those open ports. We even went as deep as discovering the version of the software.

  However before we actually attack the target and try to exploit it there is one more step to perform which is called Vulnerability Analysis. Thats right, we have all the information we need but now in Vulnerability Analysis we are going to see if those programs that are running on the target machine are fully secured or if they might have some security flaw ? Maybe they are outdated ? We don't know that yet! All of this we will see in the Vulnerability Analysis.

  But before we perform vulnerability analysis we are going to do a small project. And not just any project but out first coding project!

  We are going to see how we can create a simple ***Portscanner using Python 3\***.

  And by the way for all of you that are not a fan of command line tools, you can check out a tool exactly the same as nmap, it just has a graphical user interface! The tool is called ***Zenmap.\***

## Python Coding Project #1 - Portscanner

* ##### The 2 Paths

  In the coming section we will be using Python to code out first ethical hacking tool! Throughout the course we will be using Python which is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Although you do not need to learn Python to learn from this course *(we explain more in the next lecture)*, it may be a useful skill for you to learn. So you have two options:

  **1. If you want to learn Python,** head on over to complete all *4 Learn Python Sections* at the end of this course. Once you complete those, jump back to the next lecture here!

  **2. If you already know Python, or you are not interested in learning to program your own tools**, you can just keep going through this section, watch the video and go to *Vulnerability Analysis* section.

  Whichever you chose, have fun!

* ##### Note: Do We Need To Learn Programming To Be An Ethical Hacker ?

  **Technically no!**

  **However it is a huge huge plus** .. As we already mentioned using only tools created by other people limits you. You can never create something new even if you have an idea. Programming allows us to put that idea to work and create the program we want. Maybe programming will help you in developing an attack that wasn't used before ? Maybe you cant find a tool that you want ? Or at least it will make you understand a lot better how other programs and attacks work ..

  So even though it is not required to become an Ethical Hacker, it is a skill that you should definitely look forward to learn.

  Since in the next video we are going to be creating our first hacking tool, just a quick reminder that you have a couple hours of python for beginners videos at the end of the course in case you have no previous programming experience! If you have, feel free to continue to the next video where we create our port scanner.

  The most important library that we will use to create our program and many other programs from this course, is called **socket** library. Even though I explain what all of the functions that we use do, here is a link to socket library documentation in case you want to learn more about it and check out other possibilities with this library!

* ##### Note: We Can Also Target Routers!

  Okay, before we start targeting Windows 10 machine, I want to devote a video or two to attacking routers. Routers are important devices in our network and anyone who manages to compromise our routers pretty much has access to our network and can control our network!

  That is why we are going to talk about a tool called Routersploit that tests for known router exploits and checks for vulnerabilities and we are also going to talk about biggest problem and vulnerability that a lot of routers have!

  And that is default passwords ..

  More about all of this in next two videos!

* [Update 2 - Routersploit](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/umc81nMJTre9FU5B9OYQ)

* [Update 3 - Router Default Credentials](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/dV3ddhfSRESncjifnACG)

### SMBGhost CVE 2020-0796 - Windows 10 Manual Exploitation

* ##### Note: Not Everything Will Work Smooth!

  Why Am I Choosing A Single Exploit ?

  Well first of all this exploit just came out and it targets windows 10 machines. Depending on when you watch this video this will most likely be patched but you should still be able to find a lot of windows 10 machines that are vulnerable to this attack. That is just how it is ... people do not update their machines regularly.

  However, I am not showing this just because its new but also to show you that sometimes you have to search for different tools and exploits in order to get something to work. You wont always have it as easy as loading metasploit framework module and pressing "run". You might need to dig through github for some exploit code. Usually that exploit code will be unstable so you will also have to change a few things here and there (this is where programming skills are really useful) and even after doing all of that it still might not work! Dont worry, all of this is a part of being a penetration tester!

  Another important thing is to always keep yourself updated, because once a zero day exploit is found. You will almost never find it on known tools such as msfconsole before it gets patched. By getting hands on it as soon as possible you are ahead of the bad guys and you can help protect and secure other networks and machines.

  But I cant really point out how important programming skills will be for you in the future if you continue to work in this field. And the good part is that you dont need to be as good as "developers". Our goal is not to make cleanest code possible but only to get it to work!

  Anyways, more about programming for Ethical Hackers at the end of the course, for now lets get straight into attacking Vulnerable Windows 10 Machine!

* ##### Note: My Payloads Are Getting Detected By An Antivirus!

  A game of cat and mouse ..

  Viruses and Antiviruses!

  We are going to talk about them in the next video but I just want to mention a few things first.

  **There is no clear way of bypassing antiviruses!**

  These methods get outdated all the time and new ones occur. However there are things that you can do to make your payload less detected.

  **1)** The best possible thing that you can do is to create your own Payload (code it yourself). Why ? Well if you create it yourself chances are that same code didnt occur before and it will be unknown to the antivirus vendors. Your unique code once compiled will give a completely different binary that isnt in the database of that antivirus.

  **2)** If you dont yet know how to create your own payloads/viruses/backdoors and you are using softwares like Msfvenom or Veil or similar. Make sure to change that payload as much as possible. If there are some random options you can add, make sure to add them (such as program sleeping for X amount of seconds etc.). Then you can use hexeditor that we will see in the next video to change binary a little bit in order to get different file hash which can help you bypass some antiviruses.

  **3)** Keep an eye for new tools that are using to create payloads/make them undetectable. Both TheFatRat and Veil when they came out produced undetectable payloads. But then once tool becomes known and people start using it, those payloads are uploaded to virus total and eventually become known to antiviruses. However new tools come out all the time, so you can keep an eye out once they come out in order to possibly bypass more antiviruses with that new tool!

  **4)** IF you have a source code to the payload, try changing the code a little bit. Try adding a random function inside the code that doesnt do anything. Then once you compile the program afterwards with that random function it will give a completely different binary to you compared to other people creating payload with that tool just because you added that function.

  These are just some of the ways, and I mention them in the next video. 2 important things I would take out from this is to:

  - ***Create your own payloads\***
  - ***Keep yourself updated with new tools\***

* ##### Note: You Can Continue Building Onto This Project!

  Alright! This project was a little bit hard I admit. But we got through it. However this doesnt have to be the end of it!

  You can continue building on and adding new functions that you might find useful. There are no limitations!

  Here are some of the things you might want to add to our backdoor:

  1. Keylogger - You might want to capture keystrokes on the target machine. Keylogger would be a perfect thing to code and add as a part of our backdoor to achieve this!
  2. Elevate Privileges - Maybe you want to try to elevate privileges with this program. Perhaps you need it to access some restricted file ? There are many different ways that it can be done and if you think this is something you need. You can always add it as a new option to our code!
  3. Record Microphone & Desktop - You can add an option that will take a screenshot of targets desktop. Or even better you can maybe make your program record a microphone to perhaps hear if the person is talking to someone ?

  These are just some of the options. Feel free to add anything you think is needed!

  Now we are ready to continue to another big topic that awaits us which is Website Application Penetration Testing!

### Where To Go From Here ?

* [What is next ?](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/uF9JgZrSkGLcbcy2Ah4c)

* ##### Practice

  ***The very first thing ..\***

  Is to practice a lot! Practice makes perfect .. But remember, we can only practice on machines and systems that we have permission to target! That is why the best way to practice is to download vulnerable virtual machines and attack them. Just like we did inside of the course. After you practice on a few vulnerable machines and you become confident in your skills, you can move on to online platforms that allow you to test your penetration testing skills. One of those platforms is ***"Hack The Box"\***. Check it out!

* ##### Bug Bounty

  ***Bug Bounty ..\*** It is mostly referred to Web Application Penetration Testing. You can choose to specialise only in this field by focusing on Web Vulnerabilities. This is also something that many people want. They want to test their website security.

  And as we know there are a lot of websites on the internet. Your job will be to protect them! A good thing to do next is to take some Bug Bounty course that will teach advance topics like SQL injection, XSS , CSRF ... in more details! Once you feel more comfortable with discovering Bugs in Web Apps, you can take a look at platform called ***"BugCrowd" !\***

* ##### Coding For Hackers

  ***Coding ..\***

  We mentioned this throughout the entire course. Coding/Programming is a very important thing that you want to learn to really increase your skills as an ethical hacker/penetration tester. You can start with any programming language whatsoever! Here are some of the top Programming Languages for hackers

  1. **C**
  2. **Python**
  3. **C++**
  4. **Javascript**
  5. **Assembly**

  Feel free to start with any one of them. Once you learn the basics of a programming language you can take a programming course for hackers. I have a course myself for that which is "***Complete Python 3 Ethical Hacking Course\***". Feel free to take that one or any other if you want to boost your skills as a hacker!

* ##### Exploit Development

  ***Exploit Development ..\***

  This is arguably the hardest thing to learn as an ethical hacker. This requires years of learning and practice and there are multiple things you need to learn for this one. Firstly Exploit Developer is a person that finds "***Zero Day\***" exploits and develops a code to exploit a zero day vulnerability. However this puts you far ahead of others as you have the knowledge to find exploits yourself.

  You don't have to wait for a certain tool to come out or for someone else to create the exploit. You do it yourself.

  For this knowledge of Networking is needed. Deep Knowledge of Operating Systems is also needed. And of course a really good programming knowledge is needed! You will most likely need to learn Assembly language (low level language) which isn't easy to learn, but if you do it you are already half way done. Once you learn assembly you can dive into different debuggers and all of this knowledge combined can help you achieve a title of an Exploit Developer! Good Luck! 

* ##### Python Monthly

  Every month, I accumulate all of the best resources and articles, as well as free resources around the web for Python Developers. If you want to stay up to date with the industry and make sure you don't miss any important news, you can check out the monthly newsletter here. [**It's completely free every month**](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/?tag=PM&utm_source=udemy&utm_medium=coursecontent)!

  Ps, there is also the Machine Learning Monthly and Web Developer Monthly if you are interested which you can find [**here**](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/)**.**
