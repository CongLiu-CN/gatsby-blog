### Introduction

* [Course Outline](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/Gp86dixARmygrsLaF9lx)

* ##### All Course Resources + Notebooks

  Throughout the course there will be various links to different resources, however, one will be your source of truth.

  The course GitHub repo: https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning

  Inside you will find a "Course materials" table that contains all of the materials you'll need for the course, including:

  - **Lessons in code & text:** all videos are based on these notebooks, refer to them for code and text-based explanations of different deep learning and TensorFlow concepts.
  - **Lessons in code & text (from the videos):** notebooks containing the exact code we'll be writing together during the videos.
  - **Slides:** all slides and images used to explain different concepts throughout the course.
  - **Exercises & extra-curriculum:** each section comes with a series of challenges and extra resources to help you practice your skills and learn more.

  But possibly the most important out of all of the above will be the GitHub Discussions tab: https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/discussions

  If you have any questions, ideas, feedback or concerns, feel free to start a discussion thread, that way Daniel (the one writing this), Andrei and other students can read and offer help.

  Again, there will be more resources listed throughout the course but the GitHub repo will be the one-stop-shop for everything.

  Be sure to star it and add it to your bookmarks tab: https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning

  Happy Deep Learning!

* ##### TensorFlow Fundamentals challenge, exercises & extra-curriculum

  Massive effort on making it through the first section!

  By now you should have a high-level overview of what deep learning and neural networks are and what kind of problems they can be used for.

  And you should also be familiar with creating and manipulating tensors in TensorFlow. Because as you'll see later on, tensors are a fundamental component of representing and finding patterns in data.

  Before moving onto the next section, it's time to practice your skills!

  In the [course GitHub repo](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning) under “course materials”, you'll find a series of exercises and extra-curriculum suggestions.

  By going through these, you'll cement your foundational knowledge of deep learning and TensorFlow and be ready to start building neural networks of your own.

  See the link below for more.

  - [TensorFlow and Deep Learning Fundamentals Exercises & Extra-curriculum](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning#-00-tensorflow-fundamentals-exercises)

* ##### TensorFlow classification challenge, exercises & extra-curriculum

  Consider it classified!

  Well, not classified in the sense it’s a secret, classified in the sense you’ve now built nearly a dozen (did you count them all?) neural network classification models with TensorFlow!

  And on top of that, you learned about the power of non-linearity (non-straight lines), one of the key ingredients for neural networks to find patterns in non-linear (non-straight) data.

  By now you should be able to:

  - Describe what a classification problem is
  - Describe the input and output shapes of a classification problem
  - Build a neural network in TensorFlow to solve binary and multi-class classification problems

  The videos contained a bunch of information about the above but now it’s time to practice your skills.

  In the [course GitHub repo](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning) under “Course Materials”, you'll find a series of exercises and extra-curriculum suggestions.

  I’d recommend going through these **before** moving onto the next module.

  Because although the videos may be teaching you a lot, nothing will teach you more than writing more code.

  See the link below for more.

  - [Neural Network Classification with TensorFlow Exercises & Extra-curriculum](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/blob/main/README.md#-02-neural-network-classification-with-tensorflow-exercises)

  And remember, if you have any questions, be sure to [add them to the discussions page](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/discussions).

  **Challenge:** Think of a classification problem you’d like to work on. What are the input shapes (and information to feed to your model)? What are the ideal output shapes (what should your model classify)? Can you find an existing example of this problem online?

  Send a message with your answer(s) to the #machinelearning-datascience channel on Discord and mention my name (@mrdbourke), I’d love to hear them!

* ##### TensorFlow computer vision and CNNs challenge, exercises & extra-curriculum

  Boom boom! You’ve just taught a computer to see the world leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks and TensorFlow!

  These are the same kind of models powering use cases such as Tesla’s self-driving cars.

  How cool is that?

  You also learned how to import and preprocess some of your own custom images to predict on (because after all, that’s what we want to do with our models, use them on data outside of our notebooks).

  Specifically, you should be able to:

  - Describe different computer vision problems
  - Load and preprocess data for computer vision problems with TensorFlow
  - Build a convolutional neural network with convolutional and max pooling layers for binary and multi-class image classification
  - Save and load trained TensorFlow model

  In other words, you learned a whole bunch.

  But before heading on to learn more, you should practice what you’ve learned.

  In the [course GitHub repo](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning) under “Course Materials”, you'll find a series of exercises and extra-curriculum suggestions.

  Going through these will help you understand what’s happening within the Convolutional Neural Networks you’ve built and in turn, will help you build better models in the future.

* ##### TensorFlow Transfer Learning Part 1 challenge, exercises & extra-curriculum

  Holy smokes! We just wiped the floor with all of our previous models' thanks to the power of transfer learning.

  I hope you’re now starting to recognise the power of transfer learning and its advantages over building models from scratch all the time.

  We’re now well on our way to building a state of the art computer vision model for our Food Vision 🍔👁 problem.

  You should now be able to:

  - Describe the advantages of transfer learning
  - Preprocess image data to be able to be used with a transfer learning model
  - Navigate TensorFlow Hub in search of different pre-trained models for various problem spaces
  - Use a pre-trained TensorFlow Hub computer vision model

  Ready to practice?

  In the [course GitHub repo](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning) under “Course materials”, you'll find a series of exercises and extra-curriculum suggestions.

  TensorFlow Hub and the space of pre-trained models is vast. So practising writing more code will help you to identify when you can use a pre-trained model and when you might want to build something from scratch.

  See the link below for more.

  And remember, if you have any questions, be sure to [add them to the discussions page](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/discussions).

  **Challenge:** Create a binary image classification dataset (with 10 images of any two classes, e.g. car vs. truck) and use a pre-trained TensorFlow Hub image classification model to classify them. How does it go?

  Send a message with picture(s) of your results to the #machinelearning-datascience channel on Discord and mention my name (@mrdbourke), I’d love to see them!
